Intern on the Query team, which designs and maintains the implementation of the MongoDB Query Language, including query planning and optimization and the aggregation framework.

- Worked on query analysis features and implemented integration tests for the GA release of Field Level Encryption, a new feature enabling end-to-end encryption on the database driver level rather than the application itself. Work was critical to ensuring that customers’ data was not leaked through the encryption layer.
- Took ownership over the design specification for how to execute JavaScript for MapReduce jobs inside of MongoDB’s aggregation framework, which laid the foundation for $function and $accumulator in MongoDB 4.4.
