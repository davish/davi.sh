# RSS Feeds

Hi there! I currently have two RSS feeds for this website:

- On the [**main feed**](/rss.xml) you can find [long-form blog posts](/blog) [TIL snippets](/til) and [book reviews](/reading).
- Over on the [**newsletter feed**](/newsletter.xml) you can subscribe to my [weekly links](/weekly) posts, although you can also [subscribe to the newsletter]() if you'd prefer.
