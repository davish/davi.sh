Compared to the first two books in _Earthsea_ I was not as excited about _The Farthest
Shore_. Some of the scenes felt -- for lack of a better word -- a bit trippy, which made
the narrative found it a bit harder to follow.

Although I do understand that _Earthsea_ is marketed for a late-teen audience, I may be
getting a bit tired of the coming-of-age tropes. "The Farthest Shore" still continues to
fill out the world of _Earthsea_ and I'll say that the worldbuilding continues to be
top-notch.
