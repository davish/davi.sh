The second installment of the _Earthsea_ series, I enjoyed this book about as much as _A
Wizard of Earthsea_. Le Guin puts a lot of effort into fleshing out the world of Earthsea,
but unlike other fantasy worlds, sheâ€™s doing it through the eyes of her characters rather
than through exposition or lore dumps.

Ged, the protagonist of [book one](../wizard-of-earthsea.md), and Arha, the protagonist of
this book, grew up in completely different circumstances. They see the same world and same
events through their own differing and often conflicting perspectives. While it may sound
disorienting, the overall world feels even more coherent and real for it.
