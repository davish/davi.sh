A fun sci-fi novel that brought together a lot of parts of other series and franchises
into an interesting world: a solar-system spanning oligarchy with a caste system backed by
geenric engineering whose ruling class reveres the ancient Romans more than any
enlightenment-era political theorist.

Some parts will stick out as a bit derivative: the main setting of the book is a Hunger
Games-esque battle royale, and the strategies and political theory the main characters use
to win felt very reminiscent of Ender's Game. Even so, the book was able to weave in its
own themes. I found the narrator's internal struggles interesting to follow along with and
generally the book was a page turner.
