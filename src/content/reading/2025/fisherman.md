I read many of Le Guin's more classic entries in her Hainish Cycle back in college and
since then have been fascinated with the world she built for novels like _The Disposessed_
and _The Left Hand of Darkness_. _A Fisherman of the Inland Sea_ is a series of short
stories of which only the last three have anything to do with the universe of the Hainish
Cycle. These three all revolve around the development of instantaneous, faster than light
travel that Le Guin calls "churten theory" -- notably _not_ capitalized most of the
time. Le Guin doesn't focus on the effects of FTL travel on the society of the
Ekumen. Instead, the imprecision of the new technology opens the door to stories about
love, community, and how the narratives we tell ourselves affect the way we move through
the world.

These short stories weren't as fully baked as Le Guin's full-length novels, but in some
ways that helped the core insights behind them shine through even clearer.
