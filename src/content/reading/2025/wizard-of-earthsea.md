Until now I've only read Le Guin's science fiction work, and have wanted to give her
fantasy series _Earthsea_ a try for a while.

I really enjoyed this first installment. The societies that the protagonist ventures
through felt lived-in in a way that feels missing from some other high fantasy like the
Lord of the Rings.

The way that magic and the sorcerers and witches who perform it are weaved into the world
was really well done. "Sorcerer" is a vocation like any other, although one that's highly
valued in many places. Sorcerers and witches often fill in the role of high technology,
whether that's powered vehicles or medicine.

The magic system itself felt like it had its own internal logic, But enough mystery was
left for there to be places for Le Guin to fill in the blanks in future novels without
backing herself in a corner.

Beyond the top-level genre, _A Wizard of Earthsea_ is a coming of age story, which are
always enjoyable in their own way. Even if the "twist" was a bit predictable, the
worldbuilding was top-notch, and I'm excited to pick up the second book in the series!
