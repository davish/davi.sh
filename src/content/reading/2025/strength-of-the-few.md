This is a tough sequel to review without any spoilers for _The Will of the Many_, so I'm
not going to attempt it. **Spoiler warning for Book I below!**

----

_The Strength of the Few_ picks up right where [_The Will of the
Many_](/reading/2025/will-of-the-many) left off: Vis, the protagonist, has been
simultaneously copied into two other worlds called Luceum and Obiteum while
his story also continues back in the world of Book I, called Res. Somewhat necessarily,
each storyline is not as deep as the story in the first book. 

The politics and motivations that made me excited about _The Will of the Many_ fade into
the background of this installment. The Catenan Senate in Res is relegated to a third of
the chapters, and Vis's unfamiliarity with the other two worlds make him much less of an
astute observer of the political machinations around him there.

I mentioned in my last review that the world of Res felt shallow for how physically large
it was. I can better forgive some of that that shallowness here considering how different
Obiteum and Luceum feel. _The Strength of the Few_ shows that Islington can build deep
history and culture into his worlds when he wants to, but he sometimes thinks its better
to keep readers at an information disadvantage for the sake of the plot.

## Luceum

I absolutely loved the Luceum storyline. Readers are introduced to an entirely new world
with just enough detail to keep us engaged and excited to learn more without overwhelming
us with exposition. The way Islington uses Gaelic to represent Luceum's primary language
is great. From most readers' perspective it's the same as if he's made up his own language
without needing to be a [philologist on top of being a fantasy
author](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philology_and_Middle-earth). 

The worldbuilding in Luceum felt much more like what [Ursula K. Le
Guin](/reading/author/ursula-k-le-guin) utilizes in her _Earthsea_ books rather than the
exposition-heavy information dumps that Islington uses elsewhere that reminds me more of
_The Broken Earth Trilogy_'s latter entries.

This version of Vis also has some real character growth here in a way that was completely
missing in Obiteum and unsatisfying in Res.

## Obiteum

Obiteum reminded me of Cittagazze from _The Subtle Knife_: the world is clearly broken,
and something related to the existence of multiple worlds was what broke it. In general I
saw more influences from _His Dark Materials_ than _Red Rising_ throughout _The Strength
of the Few_. The initial imagery of Gleaners parallel Spectres in a very fun way.

Once we move from the rebel hideout of Qabr into the city of Duat, though, things start to
fall through the cracks. My book club all agreed that we needed a map of Duat to go along
with Vis's descriptions of how he is moving through the city. I would love to have learned
more about the society in Duat, its religion, and the totality of how Will works in
Obiteum. So much time is spent on the undead Iunctii, but Vis's entrance to Obiteum
introduces us to a variety of Will-based devices that aren't mentioned at all in parts II
and III.

## Res

I enjoyed learning more about the mechanics of Will and how Catenan society operates
outside the confines of the Academy. Vis is fully on the inside of "the system" now, and
seeing how Will affects everything from politics to athletics to combat was great.

The Catenan civil war completely changes the setting and unfortunately as much as we spent
learning about Catenan politics in Book I and the first half of Book II, there's so many
more forgettable Catenan senators introduced whose motivations are explained mostly
through exposition dumps.

All in, Part III's Res storyline felt very rushed. Vis makes some consequential decisions which
feel like they come out of nowhere. A new plan from Vis and Eidhin in the final 100 pages
which I assumed would form the Res plotline in Book III is somehow wrapped up in less than
a chapter. While there are strong emotional points, I ultimately don't truly _understand_
why Vis makes the decisions and alliances he does. 

## Splitting the Book

There were two very disorienting time jumps in the book: 6 weeks in Obiteum between parts
I and II, and a month in Res between parts II and III. The narration refers to events and
people that happened in the meantime without any indication of missing chapters in between
-- both times I had to double-check that my Kindle didn't glitch out and miss a few dozen
pages. Ultimately I think the location of these time jumps mark out a good place where the
book itself could have been split in two:

Book II would follow the entire Luceum storyline, Vis's time in Qabr in Obiteum, and the
Res storyline up until Excesius is killed. This can dive more deeply into how exactly Will
is used in Caten and flesh out the politics of the Senate even more.

Book III would cover the Catenan civil war and Vis's infiltration of the city of Duat in
Obiteum.

The downside of this approach would be that the three storylines would not proceed in
lockstep in time. Maybe Islington is planning some bigger payoff in the next book, but
there was one moment of "synchronism" that did not feel narratively or emotionally
powerful, so I don't think the parallel narrative gimmick is particularly worth it.

## Conclusion

Overall I enjoyed learning more about the world(s) that Islington is building. My
excitement about Luceum mostly counterbalances my confusion in Obiteum and my frustration
with how Res feels even smaller and more condensed than in the first book.

Backstory isn't bad in and of itself, but learning more history shouldn't be _the_ reason
we keep reading. I don't like when characters (and readers) learning new information
becomes the main plot tension in a story. When revealed, the "right" answers are often not
as satisfying as the possibilities and theories that readers come up with along the way.
Right now I don't know what's a plot hole and what's a conscious omission that will be
filled in later to support a twist or some other dramatic effect. The only way to find out
is to wait for the rest of the series to be published.

_The Expanse_ balanced this well: its final installment gave some satisfying answers about
the Protomolecule while leaving enough to interpretation and keeping the conclusion of the
book mostly about the characters we'd gotten to know.

Considering how the focus of _The Strength of the Few_ shifted from the motivations of
individual people and groups in Res to the cosmic forces connecting and separating the
three worlds we're now following, I'm not as optimistic that Islington will stick the
landing.
