_The Will of the Many_ started off feeling like a cross between the political setting of
_Red Rising_ and the magic system of _The Fifth Season_. The world felt big, but not
particularly filled in -- the author throws out place names and countries, and we meet
characters from different corners of the now world-spanning Catenan Republic, but the
places don't feel particularly differentiated or deep. A map would have helped here, but
maybe the author has a reason to hold one back.

While the worldbuilding wasn't as deep as what I'm normally interested in, I ultimately
found myself drawn in by the web of intrigue and competing political motications that the
narrator/protagonist finds himself surrounded by. He has no "correct" choices. He's unsure
of his own goals beyond survival. And while he's uncovering the secrets and motives of
those around him as he goes, it doesn't feel like the suspense is just the drip-drip-drip
of information -- no other character has all the pieces to the puzzle, either.

The plot is messy in such a satisfying way. I'm not sure if the focus of the second
installment will continue to be on the same story or if it will shift its attention
elsewhere. But I'll be excited to dive back in when it comes out.
