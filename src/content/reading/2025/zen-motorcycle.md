I really enjoyed this book -- its final lines even surpassed _The Great Gatsby_ as my
favorite closing lines of a novel. But I couldn't find myself justifying a rating higher
than 4/5 when I broke it down and tried to explain what exactly I enjoyed so much in it. I
caught myself after a few minutes, smiled, and realized in some ways that's what _Zen and
the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_ was all about.

I'm a very analytical person. I think that isn't particularly surprising considering I
started programming computers way before my brain finished developing. While analytic,
dualistic, "dialectical" thinking has benefited me in a lot of ways, I've come to realize
over the past few years that not everything in life can or should be intellectualized or
broken down into repeatable understanding. _Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_
gave some form and vocabulary to a lot of things I've been thinking and sometimes writing
about over the past few years. I found a lot of resonance in how the book describes how
those of us with more analytical tendencies can widen our perspective.

A description of a cross-country motorcycle trip unfolds alongside the narrator's
philosophical musings to the reader, and the two threads intersect and complement each
other at various times throughout the book. The "present-day" story starts off slow but
picks up as the philosophising half (the "Chautauqua") starts giving more depth back to
the characters in the story-half. At the end of some chapters, I found myself doing
something I've rarely, if ever, done before: I put the book down just to think through and
digest what I'd just read rather than powering full speed ahead to see what happens next.

I can't remember the last time I wanted to start a book over again as soon as I finished,
but I feel like this is a book that would really read differently the second time around
with the full context that's revealed mid-way. I think I'll just sit for a little longer
with that first impression, though.
