Back to science fiction with another installment in the Hainish Cycle! _The Telling_ is
about orthodoxy, totalitarianism, and cultural revolution. It felt different than other
sci-fi I've read from Le Guin. Instead of being a man from an alient planet like
Hain-Davenant or Annares, the narrator is an Indian-Canadian woman from Earth. While the
story takes place on the recently-uplifted planet Aka, Earth and the narrator's
rememberings and attitudes towards our home feature strongly in the book.

The Hainish Cycle is all about celebrating how our differences make us stronger while
emphasizing our common humanity. Bringing Earth to the forefront of this installment
helped drive the lesson home in a new way.
