A fun sci-fi novel that brought together a lot of parts of other series and franchises
into an interesting world: a solar-system spanning oligarchy with a caste system backed by
geenric engineering whose ruling class reveres the ancient Romans more than any
enlightenment-era political theorist.

Some parts will stick out as a bit derivative: the main setting of the book is a Hunger
Games-esque battle royale, and the strategies and political theory the main characters use
to win felt very reminiscent of Ender's Game. Even so, the book was able to weave in its
own themes. I found the narrator's internal struggles interesting to follow along with and
generally the book was a page turner.

My initial rating after finishing this book was 4/5, but I think that my experience with
the sequel, Golden Son, brought this down half a point. Golden Son expanded the world but
leaned even heavier on inspiration from other speculative fiction for some of its
important plot points.
