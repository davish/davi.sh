I read _Project Hail Mary_ for the first time soon after it came out and devoured it in a
single sitting -- ruining my night's sleep in the process. Even though I already knew the
twists and turns of the plot, I still couldn't put it down on this second
read-through. 

Just like _The Martian_, the scientific method infuses everything in this book. Moreso
than Weir's first novel, _Project Hail Mary_ has a much more compelling "human element"
about the ways we can work together across difference.

The narration and dialog both have a great and witty rhythm to them that keep the story
fun to read throughout. I'm excited to see how it translates to the screen next month!
