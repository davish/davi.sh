Who's at fault in a fatal accident involving a self-driving car? _Culpability_
investigates the abstract morality of the trolley problem while exploring the
emotional fallout of the family at the center of the story.

_Culpability_ stays firmly rooted in the experience of the narrator Noah, a successful but
run-of-the-mill lawyer at a Maryland law firm, his brilliant wife Lorelei, a digital
ethicist at the top of her field, and their three teenage children. It's a well-written,
entertaining book about parenthood and coming of age that has almost as much to say about
21st-century privelege and the American Dream as it does about ethical algorithms and
artificial intelligence. 

In short -- it was a great read, I thoroughly enjoyed it. You should pick it up!

In my own media bubble I hear a lot about continuous self improvement, and three-letter
acronyms like Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) and Universal Basic Income (UBI); forces
that to might move nations. But Holsinger reminds us that we ought to give the same
attention to how the systems we're enmeshing into our lives today will affect ourselves
and our relationships to the people we care about most.

Digital systems by design (and definition) are predicated on one and zero, absolute of
truth and falsehood. On top of these simple rules, the emergent behavior of modern
distributed systems can be so uninterpretable to most human understanding that the best
our moral frameworks and legal systems can do is just throw up their hands and shrug their
metaphorical shoulders.

During the COVID vaccine rollout, a hospital system put blame on an algorithm for a
blatantly unfair apportionment of vaccine resources that benefitted tenured medical
faculty over residents on the front lines. LLMs and diffusion models are trained to mimic
artists and authors and synthesize new works can be argued to fit in the bucket of fair
use in our legal system while still _feeling_ wrong to many of us. Our system is built
upon the assumption that mortal, moral humans are the progenitors and beneficiaries of
intellectual property. The system had already started breaking down with The Walt Disney
Company's hand on the scales, and generative AI makes its limitations even more apparent.

_Culpability_ also dives in to the limits of our legal system, espeically as it intersects
with power and privelege. Noah is a lawyer, as is his sister-in-law, and the story is set
in front of the backdrop of the police investigation of the car crash. Law itself is a
field that has tried to force human experience into discrete judgement for virtually all
of recorded history. Machine code has voltage differentials giving way to ones and zeroes;
neural networks have probabalistic predictions transformed into decisive output. The legal
system has judges and juries which give way to innocent and guilty verdicts.

I'm reminded of a piece of art I saw at The Whitney in 2019. A 3D random walk generated by
CAD software and cast into concrete which broke in half upon installation. Algorithms
follow defined rules that are encoded within them. But there's a reason we call AI
algorithms "models" -- they are based on our own incomplete and imperfect assumptions
about how the things we create will behave when they encounter the world that we inhabit.
