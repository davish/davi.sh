After [last year](../2025/tress) I wanted to give Sanderson another
shot. This time I chose one of his most popular series rather than a newer, spin-off work.

_Mistborn_ stuck pretty closely to some common fantasy tropes. I thought Sanderson's main
characters had more depth to them in the book, which contributed to me enjoying the book
slightly more than _Tress_. Allomancy is an interesting and certainly well-thought out
magic system, but ultimately the softer, more mystical magic of _Lord of the Rings_ or _A
Song of Ice and Fire_ is more to my taste these days.

I struggled the most with the dialog in this book. Sanderson's word choices for his
characters often felt grating to me and disarmingly modern for an early industrial fantasy
setting. The way that members of the city's criminal underground talked about their
profession felt awkward in the way they leaned in to modern tropes the reader would
understand rather than in-universe exposition. I don't think any character exactly said
that they were "doing the heist" or something _that_ cheesy, but many exchanges weren't
far off.

I didn't really put my finger on this until starting to read _The Well of Ascension_, the
sequel which I picked up but have stopped reading for now. But here are a few quotes that
hopefully capture what I mean:

> So I began spreading rumors in the Western Dominance, then made myself one of Lord
> Cett's advisors

The way this glosses over an indeterminate amount of time, and how a character casually
talks about penetrating the inner circle of a rival, did not feel like how someone would
talk about an operation of this importance or risk.

> Maybe this won't work -- maybe after a couple months of being besieged, we'll just end
> up giving away the city anyway.

"Being besieged" just really grated on me here. I could think of twenty ways to phrase this
that sound more natural, starting with "maybe after a couple months under siege".

These examples might seem like nitpicking, but I picked up at least one of these every
chapter or two during _Mistborn_, and it really did affect my immersion in the world.
