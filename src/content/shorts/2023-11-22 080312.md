Super interesting post by Simon Willison on the ins and outs of how journalists talk to sources and craft a narrative.

I used to think it was strange that Willison and Jacob Kaplan Moss, two co-creators of Django, were both such prolific bloggers. Seeming as Django came out of the journalism industry, however, it really shouldnâ€™t be much of a surprise.
