title: "Weekly Links #7"

I spent some time over the past week tweaking and improving this site. Not all the changes are live
yet, but every post now has an [OpenGraph preview image](./2024-02-10/card.png) to go along with
it. I got a lot of guidance from [Arne Bahlo's
post](https://arne.me/articles/static-og-images-in-astro) on how to generate SVGs in Astro and a lot
of inspiration from [Jacob Kaplan-Moss's preview
images](https://jacobian.org/cards/managing-tech-debt.png).

I find frontend development to be a creative outlet where I can still write code without feeling
like I'm doing something too similar to my day job. I've had fun thinking critically about [my
design inspirations](https://github.com/davish/davi.sh/blob/main/README.md) and trying to build
something that feels like an authentic expression of how I want to present myself on the Internet.

Without further ado, on to the links!

## Software history

- [**Typewriters and WordPerfect**](https://matduggan.com/typewriters-and-wordperfect/) (Mat
  Duggan): A trip down memory lane for some, a history lesson for me, and a window into the ways
  that the methods of distributing software can feed back on how that software is developed.

## Lessons learned

- [**(Almost) Every infrastructure decision I endorse or regret after 4 years running infrastructure
  at a
  startup**](https://cep.dev/posts/every-infrastructure-decision-i-endorse-or-regret-after-4-years-running-infrastructure-at-a-startup/)
  (Jack Lindamood): As someone who isn't in the infrastructure/DevOps space, this was an insightful
  read that gave me a more balanced perspective on AWS than the screeds against vendor lock-in that
  can bubble to the top in internet discussions.

## Programming languages

- [**Rye: A Vision Continued**](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2024/2/4/rye-a-vision/) (Armin Ronacher):
  The more batteries included software systems, the merrier! I might try to set up Rye with my next
  Python project.
- [**Kinds and Higher-Kinded Types in Haskell**](https://serokell.io/blog/kinds-and-hkts-in-haskell)
  (Gints Dreimanis): I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of what exactly higher-kinded types
  actually were, and this article was a great introduction. I've felt for a while that monads are
  way more ubiquitous than commonly understood -- `async`/`await` is a monad that almost all
  programmers in 2024 are familiar with!  Something that *isn't* ubiquitous, though, is the support
  in the type system for describing a generic monad -- that requires higher-kinded types. I do
  wonder if it's strictly necessary, though -- OCaml doesn't support higher-kinded types but still
  has [generic syntax support for monads](https://v2.ocaml.org/manual/bindingops.html). This is
  definitely something I'd like to think about some more, and maybe turn into a blog post!
- [**Physical Properties #2**](https://buttondown.email/jaffray/archive/physical-properties-2/)
  (Justin Jaffray): This series has been an approachable introduction to Cascades. People are often
  down on [dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming), and while I
  don't think it's a great way to get good signal out of technical interviews, it is a useful
  technique in real algorithms. Cascades has been my favorite example of this for a while: Justin
  doesn't use the term directly but the "optimal substructure" critical to the definition of DP
  problems is heavily implied when he talks about the "Principle of Optimiality".
