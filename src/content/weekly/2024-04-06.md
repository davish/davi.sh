Happy Saturday! It's April, I just finished doing my taxes, and I'm excited to share some
links with you all this week :)

## Memory managegment madness
 To add on to the Algoilia article about `malloc_trim` from the last newsletter, I have
two more to share:

- [**Garbage Collection for Systems
  Programmers**](https://bitbashing.io/gc-for-systems-programmers.html) (Matt Kline): I've
  been learning the lessons in this article the hard way over the past few weeks at work,
  and Matt sums it all up amazingly succinctly. Modern garbage collectors may increase
  latency due to GC pauses but don't really reduce raw throughput in terms of operations
  per second -- whether or not that tradeoff is worth it is up to your specific use case.

- [**Underrust: What does vec![0u8; 1024] really
  do?**](https://darkcoding.net/software/rust-zeroed-vector-allocation/) (Graham King):
  One of those extremely narrow and deep dives down a line of code most programmers don't
  think much about, but whose performance characteristics can make a huge difference in
  systems. I'd love to start writing deep dives like this someday.


  
## Human-computer Interfaces
  
- [ ] [**Type Inference Was a
  Mistake**](https://borretti.me/article/type-inference-was-a-mistake) (Fernando Boretti):
  I love strong type systems, and yet my least favorite languages are not Python and
  JavaScript, but C++ and Java(8), where specifying types over and over again is almost
  always mandatory. Fernando has an interesting perspective in this post which focuses on
  Hindley-Milner type inference in OCaml. An interesting point from the end of the post:
  "I don’t want to infer types from my code. I’d rather infer the code from the types."

- [**llm cmd undo last git commit**](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/26/llm-cmd/)
  (Simon Willison): It's still so early in figuring out the right paradigms for
  interacting with generative AI for productive work, and experimentation in this space is
  exciting to see. This "prompt, confirm, execute" loop feels promising to me.
  

## Computing and society

 - [**This Video Has 71,650,121 Views**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxV14h0kFs0) (Tom
  Scott): An introduction to what an API is for a less technical audience, and also a
  powerful meditation on the fragility of the modern Web. 

- [**Universities have a Computer Science
  problem**](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/03/computing-college-cs-majors/677792/)
  (Ian Bogost): I've long thought that universities have been too slow to adapt to how
  much computing and the Internet have permeated our enire economy -- academic computer
  science programs are overcrowded and are not actually teaching what most undergraduate
  students who enroll in them are looking for. This was a great summary of the state of
  affairs with some perspectives about where to go from here.
  
 - [**Will AI Break the Internet? Or Save
   It?**](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/05/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-nilay-patel.html)
   (Nilay Patel on The Ezra Klien Show): Ezra and Nilay are good friends from Ezra's days
   at Vox and their raport helps carry this insightful podcast episode focused on how our
   society and economy will need to adapt from the changes that generative AI is bringing
   to the culture and media landscapes.
