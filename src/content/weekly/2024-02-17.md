It's a snowy day in New York City! Nice day to post up in a warm and cozy caf√© to watch it
all go by.

## Open Source

- [**Paying people to work on open source is good
  actually**](https://jacobian.org/2024/feb/16/paying-maintainers-is-good/) (Jacob
  Kaplan-Moss): Anyone who believes that American capitalism properly rewards people for
  even just the economic value they provide to society should take some time learning
  about open source software. How to sustainably fund open source contributors is
  undoubtedly a Hard Problem with no Easy Answer. What _is_ easy on the internet is
  letting idealism blind one to pragmatic, incremental solutions -- Jacob steers clear of
  that with a great piece on how we should celebrate anyone who can make a living working
  on open source regardless of ideological purity.
- [**Ghostty Devlog 006**](https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-devlog-006) (Mitchell
  Hashimoto): I've learned something from each of the Ghostty dev logs, and it's inspiring
  seeing Mitchell pump out high-quality software year after year.
- [**Numderline**](https://thume.ca/numderline/) (Tristan Hume): Anyone who stares at
  benchmarks or log lines in their terminal will appreciate this font hack.

## From the webring
- **[Half My Life](https://pawa.lt/posts/2024/02/half-my-life/)** (Peyton Walters): A
  powerful reflection on motivation, craft and finding joy in what we do.

## Technical Reference

- [**Popular git config
  options**](https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/02/16/popular-git-config-options/) (Julia Evans): A
  great list that I'll be pulling into own config.
- [**How to Center a Div**](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/center-a-div/) (Josh Comeau):
  A common, simple question with complex answers broken down into easily understandable
  bits. A post that I'm sure to turn back to lots for a long time.

## The kitchen sink

- [**New York ACTUALLY HAS 12 SEASONS**](https://12seasons.nyc) (Devon Peticolas): This
  website brings a meme alive makes it feel real and tangible, with a little bit of
  programming.
- [**Why Software Engineers like
  Woodworking**](https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/why-software-engineers-like-woodworking/)
  (Zain Rizvi): I haven't done any woodworking since woodshop in high school, but this
  post still resonated. 
- [**A bird's eye view of Polars**](https://pola.rs/posts/polars_birds_eye_view/): Query
  optimization isn't just for databases! This was a cool look into other places that query
  engines can be useful outside of strict database systems.
