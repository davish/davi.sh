I took a vacation this week, so I'm writing this weekly with more of a laid-back attitude.

### Product Design
- [**Sometimes the product innovation is the
  distribution**](https://interconnected.org/home/2024/09/27/distribution) (Matt Webb): An
  interesting story about how Moleskine "hacked" into bookshop distribution and what it
  can mean for tech businesses in general.
- [**Ink & Switch**](https://www.inkandswitch.com): This independent research lab / design
  studio has put together some really thought-provoking proofs of concept.
  
### Just plain fun
- [**Every UUID Dot Com**](https://everyuuid.com): This gave me a chuckle. [The
  writeup](https://eieio.games/blog/writing-down-every-uuid/) of how this got made is also
  worth a read.

### Databases
- [**DSQL Vignette: Reads and
  Compute**](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2024/12/04/inside-dsql.html) (Marc Brooker):
  Calling the SQL engine the "easy half of a database system" is certainly a choice, but
  this was an interesting look into a new database offering from AWS. I found this entry
  [via Simon
  Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/6/dsql-vignette-reads-and-compute/), but it
  looks like the whole series is already [posted on Marc's
  blog](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2024/12/04/inside-dsql.html). It seems like much of the
  secret sauce is in how "adjudicator" instances coordinate with each other, which
  unfortuantely isn't discussed in the series.
- [**DELETEs are difficult**](https://notso.boringsql.com/posts/deletes-are-difficult/)
  (Radim Marek): The title kind of says it all. This was a deep dive into how row
  deletions are processed in Postgres and why they're expensive.
- [**Turning Your Root URL Into a DuckDB Remote
  Database**](https://www.dbreunig.com/2024/12/01/turning-your-root-url-into-a-duckdb-remote-database.html)
  (Drew Breunig): A fun reminder that there's other ways to experience the internet than
  in a Web browser. If I wasn't running this blog as a static site on Netlify, this would
  be a fun thing to try out. Even so I might try embedding a SQLite database somewhere
  around here.
