title: "Weekly Links #20"
date: 2025-01-19

Hello again! I realized I messed up my automated email schedule up a bit and last week's
newsletter was sent out this evening, a full week late. Sorry for that! As an apology to
my O(10) newsletter subscribers, you'll see two posts in 24 hours -- going forward the
newsletter will get sent out Monday mornings rather than Sunday evenings to account for
any late editions.

### What I'm listening to
Normally I write this post in a coffee shop where I try to enjoy the barista's playlist rather
than put my own music on, but this week I'm writing from home while a few inches of snow
come down outside. I'm listening to
[Lawrence](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5rwUYLyUq8gBsVaOUcUxpE?si=_gYt8VJGScy_FvoQyVi0BQ)
, [Couch](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3nYyLjhw4mYzYfJePsCJYJ?si=95c4ad295472465b),
[Ripe](https://open.spotify.com/artist/19lQ2rJLlP71FOKESiMNJT?si=04d0609857d34e76) and
other similar bands on [a Spotify
mix](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E35hP85frhhed?si=4c7e71c160ec4485).

### Miscellaneous reading
- [**You should get a blog**](https://www.hughrundle.net/you-should-get-a-blog/) (Hugh
  Rundle): "Motivational meta-posts" might be over-saturated on newsletter now, but I do
  always enjoy reading these.
- [**On the Gracchi, Part I: Tiberius
  Gracchus**](https://acoup.blog/2025/01/17/collections-on-the-gracchi-part-i-tiberius-gracchus/)
  (Bret Devereaux): This was a great essay about how the Gracchi's norm breaking behavior
  shaped the century-long fall of the Roman Republic.
- [**Why is Git Autocorrect too fast for Formula One
  drivers**](https://blog.gitbutler.com/why-is-git-autocorrect-too-fast-for-formula-one-drivers/)?
  (Scott Chacon): Some really fun programming archaeology here. I hadn't learned about
  deciseconds before and it was fun to hear another way text-based config languages can
  bite you.

### AI

- [**An "oh fuck" moment in time**](https://ghuntley.com/oh-fuck/) (Geoffrey Huntley): A
  similar realization to my blurb about Cursor last week. Data wall or not, it's going to
  be an exciting few years while we all figure out where LLMs fit into productivity
  workflows.
- [**AI's Uneven Arrival**](https://stratechery.com/2025/ais-uneven-arrival/) (Ben
  Thompson): From one angle, it's a restatement of Christiansen's disruption theory. From
  another angle it's another piece by Thompson that helps frame current events in tech in
  a historical context.
