Hello again! It's been too long since I've published a newsletter. Routines are hard to
build, but I do still want to try to make writing a weekly habit of mine.

Luckily I haven't been publishing because I've been keeping busy offline, so I can't
complain too much. But anyways, on to the weekly!

## From the webring

- [**September, 2022**](https://aryav.substack.com/p/september-2022) (Aryav Pal): Some
  poetry to start off this weekend: I find Aryav's writing somehow both vivid and vague in
  a way that lets you fill in the space between the lines with your own imagery and
  memories.

## Programming for its own sake

- [**Programming Jigs**](https://buttondown.email/j2kun/archive/programming-jigs/) (Hillel
  Wayne): As someone who hasn't used a table saw since high school, I still often feel
  drawn to the woodworking/programming analogy. Another great essay from Hillel on the
  craft of programming and what we can learn from other disciplines.
- [**Fifty Things you can do with a Software Defined
  Radio**](https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/): I'd heard of SDR before but I never
  really considered how many different broadcasts are traveling through the air all the
  time, all around us.
  
## Databases

- [**DuckDB as the New jq**](https://www.pgrs.net/2024/03/21/duckdb-as-the-new-jq/) (Paul
  Gross): SQL might not be the most beautiful language but its ubiquity lends itself to
  versatililty. Sometimes fluency in a technology is reason enough to make larger use of
  it, especially for building jigs like Hilel wrote about above.
  
## Systems

- [**When allocators are hoarding your prescious
  memory**](https://www.algolia.com/blog/engineering/when-allocators-are-hoarding-your-precious-memory/)
  (Algolia Engineering): I ran into this issue at work this week, and it kind of melted my
  brain learning that `free()` doesn't actually free memory back to the kernel, at least
  with the default implementation of malloc/free on Linux. I might try to write my own
  blog post about this if I can figure out how to make a minimal reproduction.
- [**Latency Numbers Every Programmer Should Know**](https://samwho.dev/numbers/) (Sam
  Rose): Computers are fast, but not infinitely so. Caring about these kinds of
  bottlenecks and numbers is, for me, one of the things that separates programming from
  software engineering.
