title: "Weekly Links #30"
date: 2025-12-22

Another batch of links, coming your way! While I'm a little sad this weekly didn't follow
on the heels of #29, I can't complain too much. I spent some time working on a new side
project!

I'm working on my own little algorithmic newsfeed prioritized by what I think is most
important. I subscribe to a ton of RSS feeds that all publish on different frequencies. I
want to make sure that infrequent publishers are never drowned out by more frequent
posters. Whenver I check the feed, I want posts from weekly authors for this week to show
up alongside posts from monthly authors for this month _before_ any content from daily
newsletters. At this point I've set up a lot of the infrastructure to ingest RSS feeds and
spit out a ranked version. Next is actually working on a good algorithm!

Anyways, I've still got a lot of thoughts on articles I've read over the past few
weeks. Time to get to it!

## Engineering Management
  
- [**Seeing like a software
  company**](https://www.seangoedecke.com/seeing-like-a-software-company/) (Sean
  Goedecke): I've often thought about why large organizations are so ineffecient. In the
  past I've chalked it up to the coordination overhead between any two people that scales
  exponetnionally in larger networks. But Sean Goedecke makes a stronger claim that
  efficienty is intentionally sacrificed for _legibility_ and _steerability_. 
  
  I've only recently stumbled upon Goedecke's writing, but his experience inside GitHub
  (which itself is inside the much-larger Microsoft) offers an interesting perspective
  that isn't often present on the indie blogosphere.
  
- [**Transparent Leadership Beats Servant
  Leadership**](https://entropicthoughts.com/transparent-leadership-beats-servant-leadership)
  (Christoffer Stjernlöf): This post really struck a chord with me and in many ways has
  helped me set a new north star for my career. Christoffer presents a view of management
  as coaching and facilitation over top-down decision making.
  
  After your team is more-or-less autonomous, what then? "The manager should turn into a
  high-powered spare worker, rather than a paper-shuffler." Managers often have a
  birds-eye view that can give insight into what tasks can be particularly high-leverage
  at any given moment. The manager-as-spare-worker lets the team stay focused while they
  jump in and let themselves be redirected more aggressively.
  
- [**Why I Ignore The Spoltight as a Staff
  Engineer**](https://lalitm.com/software-engineering-outside-the-spotlight/) (Lalit
  Maganti): I feel like a lot of ink has been spilled refuting Sean Goedecke's various
  posts over the past few months. All these takes complement the opinion they're refuting
  invalidate them. Lalit's post is a great counter-narrative about how to dive deep within
  an organization.
  
  I appreciated that Lalit called out that "The foundational reason for our diverging
  paths is that Sean and I operate in entirely different worlds with different laws
  governing them." Product engineering and infrastructure have different incentives, and
  Sean doesn't have to be "wrong" for Lalit to be "right". Different experience can lead
  us to different conclusions, and that's okay!
  
## Tech and Society
  
- [**Software Engineers Are Not
  Politicians**](https://alexwennerberg.com/blog/2025-11-28-engineering.html) (Alex
  Wennerberg): Another Goedeke repsonse piece that I enjoyed. The part on "delivering
  value" was an expecially interesting read. Sticking to what's valuable, and having an
  understanding of value beyond the price tag or revenue number, is paramount to actually
  building something that can last.
  
- [**The Resonant Computing Manifesto**](https://resonantcomputing.org/): Another piece on
  the topic of value in technology. There's been a lot of talk about AI as a force for
  [enshittification](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/). But the inflection
  point that we're at could point in another direction: "we can now build technology that
  adaptively shapes itself in service of our individual and collective aspirations. We can
  build resonant environments that bring out the best in every human who inhabits them." 
  
  I support the idea wholeheartedly -- I've thought a bit of what LLM-enhanced
  [Programmable Ink](https://www.inkandswitch.com/ink/) would look like. But it seems like
  the economic energy is already moving towards passive consumption platforms that Sora
  has shown us a preview of.
  
  Programmers and technoligists have for a long time championed computing as a means of
  creation even as computers have been used by most of the public as a means of
  consumption. [Revealed preference is a stronger force than stated
  preference](https://stratechery.com/2021/instagrams-evolution/), unfortunately, and I'm
  not sure what we can do about that.
  
- [**Ghostty Is Now Non-Profit**](https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-non-profit)
  (Mitchell Hashimoto): Nothing much to add here. Just excited to see Mitchell continuing
  to do the right thing with Ghostty!

## Actual Software

- [**Thoughts on Go vs. Rust
  vs. Zig**](https://sinclairtarget.com/blog/2025/08/thoughts-on-go-vs.-rust-vs.-zig/)
  (Sinclair Target): PL comparisons are one of the most emotional and least productive
  sub-genres of technical writing. This was the most thoughtful and
  first-principles-driven language comparison I'd read on the topic in a while. Explaining
  when each language is useful in its own context was a great addition that I wish more
  people took into account when comparing programming languages.
  
- [**We are in the "gentleman scientist" era of AI
  research**](https://www.seangoedecke.com/ai-and-informal-science/) (Sean Goedecke): This
  was an interesting thought for me. There's a capability overhang with existing LLMs and
  also an engineering overhang in how to most effectively train a transformer model that
  the barrier to entry is not particularly high for novel research. Who knows when that
  door will close, but it hasn't happened yet!
  
- [**The CRDT
  Dictionary**](https://www.iankduncan.com/engineering/2025-11-27-crdt-dictionary) (Ian
  Duncan): This was an amazing resource to encounter! A single page is pretty limiting,
  though. I really wish there was better browse-ability and categorization among all these
  different kinds of CRDTs. The interactive demos were also enlightening.
  
- [**I Tried Glean for Advent of Code, and I Get the
  Hype**](https://blog.tymscar.com/posts/gleamaoc2025/) (Oscar Molnar): I got a chuckle
  out of how much of this article boiled down to standard library functions derived from
  OCaml rather than anything unique about Glean as a language.
