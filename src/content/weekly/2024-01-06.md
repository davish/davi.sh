title: "Weekly Links #2"

I hope everyone had a good first week of 2024! I set some New Year's resolutions this year (like I
have [in the past](https://davi.sh/blog/2022/01/digital-mindfulness/)). We'll see how they stick --
I've tried to make them vague enough that they'll be difficult to objectively "fail" at, but only
time will tell. Anyways, on to the links:

- **[Flakes aren't real and cannot hurt you](https://jade.fyi/blog/flakes-arent-real/)**: This was
  one of the best technical posts I've read in a while. I mentioned in [my
  post](https://davi.sh/blog/2023/12/what-i-like-about-nix/) that Flakes were the first thing to
  really make Nix stick for me. This post gave me a lot deeper of an understanding of their
  tradeoffs and how they fit into the wider Nix ecosystem.
- **[9 years of Apple text editor solo dev](https://papereditor.app/dev)**: This article was a great mix
  of technical and business learnings.
- [**Fixing Macs Door to Door**](https://matduggan.com/fixing-macs-door-to-door/): I can best
  describe this blog post as a virtual page-turner. Similar to the post above, the secret sauce was
  how it mixed technical content with less technical subject matter. The post was a really
  interesting peek into socioeconomics around the Great Recession[^1].
- [**A CAP tradeoff in the
  wild**](https://decomposition.al/blog/2023/12/31/a-cap-tradeoff-in-the-wild/): It's always cool
  seeing how theory rears its head in practice, especially in a project as big as Kubernetes. It's
  interesting how someone had an issue, and it's only in the follow-up where it's recognized as a
  manifestation of the CAP theorem.
  
  [^1]: If it sounds like I'm talking about a historical event here, I was, well, 10 years old at the
    time. I did happen to graduate during the subsequent economic crisis of 2020, though, so it was
    interesting drawing parallels.
    
## From the vault
- [**An Engine For An Editor**](https://matklad.github.io/2023/03/08/an-engine-for-an-editor.html):
  Emacs is super interesting. Not much more needs to be say. Alex Kladov has a great blog, and this
  post is no exception.
