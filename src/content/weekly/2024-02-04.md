Happy February! I had a high school teacher of mine call month #2 the F-month: a month so terrible
it wasn't even worth naming. While February does tend to be the coldest month here in New York,
there's still plenty to take advantage of -- It's always easier to find tables at my favorite bars
when the weather's bad outside :)

## Software
- [**jj init**](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/essays/jj-init) (Chris Krycho): A great deep dive into
  [jujitsu](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj) and how its mental model draws on and differs from
  current-gen version control systems. I've felt fow a while that Git+GitHub has some major
  shortcomings when it comes to collaboration, and I'm excited to see how new tools like jujitsu and
  [Graphite](https://graphite.dev) start to change the status quo.
- [**Long Term Refactors**](https://max.engineer/long-term-refactors) (Max Chernyak): Technical
  challenges are often unseparable from their related organizational challenges. This post was an
  interesting breakdown on how to adress both sides of the coin.
- [**Stanchion**](https://github.com/dgllghr/stanchion): Stanchion is a SQLite extension that adds
  column-oriented tables to SQLite. It's cool to see how someone was able to tack on column-oriented
  data structures to row-oriented SQLite. I'd be interested to see what performance benefits they're
  able to get on analytic queries, though.

## Career and Culture
- [**Work hard and take everything
  seriously**](https://macwright.com/2024/01/28/work-hard-and-take-everything-seriously.html) (Tom
  Macwright): This post articulated really well something I'd been thinking about for a while:
  Working hard for the sake of "the grind" is almost never worth it: it's important to make sure
  that you're personally getting something out of the work you put in. It was also another reminder
  of the ways in which life can be far from zero-sum. The whole post is worth reading (like
  everything in this weekly), but I wanted to quote the last two paragraphs:
  
> You can burn out by going too fast, or your flame can dim because you don’t let yourself spend
> silly amounts of time on silly projects to satisfy your intellectual curiosity. Beware of both
> outcomes: cultivate your enthusiasm for the things you want to hang onto.
> 
> It isn’t a revolutionary idea that people who are excellent in their fields often get there by
> trying really hard. If you can figure out the difference between busy-work that only benefits your
> employer, and the kind of work that makes you as a person feel like you’re making progress and
> becoming more skilled, then you’re ready to learn.

## From the archives
- [**Was Javascript really made in 10
  days?**](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/did-brendan-eich-really-make-javascript-in-10-days/)
  ([Hillel Wayne](https://www.hillelwayne.com)): A look into the history behind what is probably one
  of the most common truisms in software. I learned a lot about JavaScript specifically and the
  environment at Netscape at the time -- I had no clue that there was an actual deal with Sun to
  make the language more "Java-like," for one.
