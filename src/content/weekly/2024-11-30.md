Happy Saturday! After sending off last week's installment I finally finished up and
published [part 3 of my Nix-on-macOS series](/blog/2024/11/nix-vscode/). This was sitting
in my drafts folder for a long while and I'm happy to have gotten it out there. I have
some more ideas for posts in the series to write, but I also want to start thinking about
other series and topics I can explore.

### Writing on writing
- [**Always. Be. Blogging.**](https://www.natesilver.net/p/always-be-blogging) (Nate
  Silver): Always interesting to learn about the process of someone who you've followed
  for a long time. I think the advice here can apply to any kind of self-guided work.
  
### Programming Languages
- [**The algebra (and calculus!) of algebraic data
  types**](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/three/algebra-and-calculus-of-algebraic-data-types)
  (Joel Burget): This post draws parallels between the cardinality of different basic
  functional data types and laws of arithmetic, algebra and differentiation. On first
  blush, it seems absolutely mind-blowing. The author is ready to admit towards the end
  that the analogy is still incomplete. I don't have a deep enough mathematical background
  to be able to judge whether this correspondence is coincidence, trivial, or profound,
  but there's enough links out to academic papers and other posts on the subject to dig
  deeper and read more.
  
  I'm reminded of when I learned about `e` in pre-calc class in high school. At first I
  was almost convinced that the recurrence of this number in everything from compound
  interest to radioactive decay was evidence of divine intervention. After a few more
  classes it all seemed a lot more pedestrian: if all exponential functions are
  transformations of each other, there needs to be one with unit coeffecients -- and `e`
  falls right out of that -- it's why it's the base of the "natural" log. 
  
  That whole thought process was a good lesson in how abstractions can feel like magic if
  you don't have a deep understanding of how they work.
- [**Haskell: A Great Procedural
  Language**](https://entropicthoughts.com/haskell-procedural-programming) (Chris,
  Entropic Thoughts): I feel like every week I'm posting a new article that looks at
  monads in a new way, but somehow I still find them interesting. 
- [**Swift for C\+\+ Practitioners, Part 11: Domain-Specific Languages with Result
  Binders**](https://www.douggregor.net/posts/swift-for-cxx-practitioners-dsls/) (Doug
  Gregor): I've really enjoyed this series and this installment was no exception. I'm
  surprised that a special protocol is required. The [equivalent functionality in
  Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/type-safe-builders.html) just falls out of
  trailing lambdas.
  
### Software in the real world
- [**Shrinking a Postgres
  Table**](https://www.johnnunemaker.com/shrinking-a-postgres-table/) (John Nunemaker): A
  story mostly about how AI chatbots can help with a squishy, real-world problem. I sensed
  some echoes of [my post on ChatGPT](/blog/2023/03/gpt-right-questions/) from a few years
  back.
- [**Storing times for human
  events**](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Nov/27/storing-times-for-human-events/#atom-everything)
  (Simon Willison): I'm a big fan of this sub-genre of the indie technical blog sub-genre:
  thorough writeups of hard-won knowledge from years of experience in the industry.
