title: "Weekly Links #5"
date: 2024-01-21

Happy Sunday! 

I have Lobsters and Hacker News blocked on my devices because I'm way to prone to
refreshing those constantly. I rely on my RSS feed that I've curated over the past few years which
also includes some other curators like [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net) and [John
Gruber](https://daringfireball.net). I'm thinking about how I can still discover new authors without
scrolling on autopilot, especially on Lobsters, where I find the submissions to be really
high-quality. 

Maybe these weekly links posts can be part of a prompt to an LLM that can trawl
through all the submissions and help find a sample that I'll be most interested in? Rather than
filtering out any posts, it could just rank them from "most likely to be interesting" to least
likely. I'm still trying to rely less on algorithms, but I'm curious how I could incorporate an
algorithm that I control into my own curation. 

Anyways, on to the weekly.

## Tech, science, and society
- [**The Open Source Sustainability
  Crisis**](https://openpath.chadwhitacre.com/2024/the-open-source-sustainability-crisis/) (Chad
  Whitacre): This is a topic I've thought about a lot, and while this article focuses way more on
  the problems than possible solutions, I think that the economic question of how we as a society
  make sure we're compensating folks that create value that's distributed at no marginal cost on the
  Internet, whether they're making software or art, is something all of us should be thinking about.
- [**The Most Dangerous Rock in the World**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-FuqptTZow) (Welch
  Labs on Youtube): A look into the collaboration and competition across Europe throughout the early
  20th century that ultimately led to the development of the Atomic Bomb. This was a great
  counterpoint to the singular focus on individual "great man" scientists in pop culture, showing
  how scientific breakthroughs are often the result of decades of incremental and collaborative work
  among the whole community.
  
## Nix and code
- [**How to Learn Nix, Part 48: Installing (single-user) Nix on
  macOS**](https://ianthehenry.com/posts/how-to-learn-nix/installing-nix-on-macos/) (Ian Henry): I
  find Ian's written voice one of the most entertaining I've encountered in the indie tech
  blogosphere, and this post into a more bespoke Nix setup was interesting as I've gotten into Nix
  more recently.
- [**Nix from the bottom up**](http://www.chriswarbo.net/projects/nixos/bottom_up.html) (Chris
  Warbo): I've been learning Nix more from the "top-down", thinking about what configuration I'd
  like to centralize and figuring out how Nix can help me out. This article helped fill in some of
  my conceptual gaps in how Nix works under the hood.
- [**Ruby (3.3) on Rails (1.0)**](https://nashby.github.io/2024/01/15/ruby-3-on-rails-1/) (Vasily
  Ermolovich): Working on database systems, I've spent a lot of time thinking about both backwards
  and forwards compatibility. This was a cool dive into digital archaeology that also shows how
  challenging cross-version compatibility can be.

## From the archives
- [**Inside New Query Engine of
  MongoDB**](https://laplab.me/posts/inside-new-query-engine-of-mongodb/) (Nikita Lapkov): Nikita
  and I overlapped on the Query team at MongoDB, and this deep dive that he wrote after leaving was
  a great overview for anyone interested in high-performance interpreters, query engines, or
  programming language implementation in general.
