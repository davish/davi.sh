Happy November! I spent the weekend visiting friends in Cambridge, MA and am on an Amtrak
train back to New York. We're a bit past peak fall-foliage season, but I'm hoping for a
good view over the water between Providence and New Haven.

## Data Infrastructure

- [**TernFS -- An Exabyte Scale, Multi-Region Distributed
  Filesystem**](https://www.xtxmarkets.com/tech/2025-ternfs/) (XTX Markets): It's not
  often we get a comprehensive peek into distributed systems of this scale. My main
  takeaway: avoid single points of coordination as much as possible, and sure any
  coordination across multiple hosts is only required for low-throughput operations.
  
- [**Small Data**](https://topicpartition.io/definitions/small-data) (Stanislav
  Kozlovski): Even as machine learning eats up more and more CPU cores, GPUs and hard
  drives, this post proves that most other data needs firmly _do not_ fit into that
  bucket. Small data can get away without distributed systems, but they certainly still
  benefit from improvements and technologies developed to support big data.

## Software Engineering

- [**Be Simple**](https://corrode.dev/blog/simple/): Much ink has been spilled over
  premature optimization, but premature generalization can be just as bad of an
  instinct. I liked the narrative structure of this post and also definitely agree with
  the takeaways. Optimize code for readability over writeability, and make sure errors are
  legible and actionable to whoever's on call.

- [**How to Fix Any Bug**](https://overreacted.io/how-to-fix-any-bug/) (Dan Abramov): A
  well-written post demonstrating how good software engineering practices -- in this case,
  spending time automating a reproduction of a bug -- still matter in the age of LLM
  assistance.

- [**Vibing a Non-Trivial Ghostty
  Feature**](https://mitchellh.com/writing/non-trivial-vibing) (Mitchell Hashimoto):
  Vibecoding still requires a lot of manual work and understanding to make something truly
  production-ready. My main takeaway came from Mitchell's description of the time he spent
  structuring the view model for this feature. I wholeheartedly second this advice: if you
  spend time defining your protocol types well it's a lot harder for an LLM to go off the
  rails.

- [**Use the saw, fear the saw**](https://stephango.com/saw) (Steph Ango): Dangerous tools
  are powerful tools, and powerful tools are dangerous tools, too. I've always appreciated
  the programming-as-woodworking analogy and Steph's extension of to LLMs and power saws
  clicked for me. So many technologies are "dual use" and it's important to think about
  both edges to the blade.
