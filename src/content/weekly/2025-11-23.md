Colder weather means November's the first month with two newsletters in a long
while. Let's hope I can keep up the pace as we head into the holiday season!

- [**Comment on "Thinking about Thinking with
  LLMs"**](https://lobste.rs/s/yzbn8j/thinking_about_thinking_with_llms#c_riw1mz) (Simon
  Willison): When I submitted [my most recent blog post](/blog/2025/10/thinking-with-llms/)
  to Lobsters I was not expecting [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/) to say he
  "couldn't agree more", but it was certainly a high point of my blogging
  career so far!  His comment mentioned Brad Fitzpatrick's chapter in Coders at Work,
  which has also had an impact on me since I read it over the holidays in 2022. I thought
  his take at the end was a great addendum to the post:
  
  > There's so much low-level stuff that [LLMs] can help me understand way faster than if
  > I was to try and dig out the details myself. Just this morning I was [poking at
  > WebAssembly compiled
  > binaries](https://chatgpt.com/share/6907b70b-948c-8006-9b8a-a4e52748ae88) and learned
  > a decent amount about how that format works. Curiosity engines!

- [**Towards interplanetary QUIC
  traffic**](https://ochagavia.nl/blog/towards-interplanetary-quic-traffic/) (Adolfo
  Ochagravía): I love outer space, I love technical blog posts, so this was a slam-dunk
  for me. I didn't know much about QUIC but it was an interesting exercise to see how the
  requirements of the Deep Space Network can be translated into a protocol designed for
  terrestrial usecases.
  
- [**More Than DNS: The 14 hour AWS us-east-1
  outage**](https://thundergolfer.com/blog/aws-us-east-1-outage-oct20) (Jonathon Belotti):
  Jonathon shows a deep sense of software systems as a part of larger human systems. I've
  been working in the industry for almost half a decade but I still haven't truly
  developed this skill yet. Amidst an outage can be a difficult time to zoom out and
  reflect on organizations and culture, but it's often the most important time to do so.
  
- [**A Very Early History of Algebraic Data
  Types**](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/algdt-history/) (Hillel Wayne): Another great
  piece of digital archaeology from Hillel. This is history as a discipline as much as
  anything I've seen in the computer science field: his sources here aren't perfect,
  and Hillel artfully fills in the gaps to create a convincing and informative narrative.
  
- [**I use Typst now**](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/i-use-typst-now) (Chris
  Biscardi): While I haven't had to write any LaTeX since undergrad, Typst has caught my
  eye a while back as an interesting typesetting alternative with a lot of potential for
  more than just academic papers. They recently added HTML output, making it possible to
  integrate easily into a SSG blog.
  
  I've long been [trying to figure out](https://github.com/davish/davi.sh/pull/13) how to
  write talk slides in text files and also cross-post as blog posts with speaker
  notes. Markdown isn't expressive enough to do this well, and Typst has a great export
  story for PDFs, so I'm somewhat interested in trying this out. I'm not sure if I really
  want to add another file format to this blog just yet, but I'll certainly be keeping an
  eye on this space!
