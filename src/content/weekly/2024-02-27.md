Apologies for the delayed weekly this week -- it may be Tuesday, but it's still the same
content you've come to appreciate and expect!

## Personal updates
- I've got [a new homepage](https://davi.sh)! I've been wanting to start over with my
  homepage for a while and I'm very happy with how it turned out. I took inspiration from
  a few new places around the web, but it still feels like my own.

- I posted the [second installment in my Nix on macOS
  series](https://davi.sh/blog/2024/02/nix-home-manager/) last weekend too. Someone left
  [a really encouraging comment on
  Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/s/usq8dk/managing_dotfiles_on_macos_with_nix#c_xs8mp3). I've
  still got a lot of posts planned for this series, so stay tuned!

## From the webring

- [**Left foot, right foot**](https://aryav.substack.com/p/left-foot-right-foot) (Aryav
  Pal): Aryav's a great writer, and I really enjoyed this article and its message.

## Programming Languages

- [**Query optimization works because sql is
  declarative**](https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/unexplanations-sql-declarative/)
  (Jamie Brandon): SQL is weird, and this was a cool look into how part of its weirdness
  may contribute to its effectiveness and staying power.
  
## Fun hacks

- [**htmz**](https://leanrada.com/htmz/) (Lean Rada): htmx has been interesting to learn
  about, and I was pretty blown away by this little project, and how much could be done
  with so little code.

- [**Happy New Year: GPT in 500 lines of
  SQL**](https://explainextended.com/2023/12/31/happy-new-year-15/): Just kind of crazy
  that this works?
  
- [**Quicksort with Jenkins for Fun and No Profit**](https://susam.net/jenkins-quicksort.html)
  (Susam Pal): Turing completeness keeps bearing fruit year after year.

## Tech? Politics? You decide

- [**AI Stole Our Jobs**](https://kevincox.ca/2024/02/17/ai-stole-our-jobs/) (Kevin Cox):
  How tech affects the rest of our society is something we all should be thinking about,
  and how Kevin articulates the example with coal plants versus cheap solar was really
  illuminating.
