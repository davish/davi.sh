title: "Weekly Links #1"
date: 2023-12-30

I find a lot of cool articles around the internet, and inspired by
[some](https://arne.me/weekly) [other](https://webcurios.co.uk/) weekly links
collections I've come across recently, I thought I'd start my own little bloglet.

## This week

- [You don't need analytics on your
  blog](https://blog.yossarian.net/2023/12/24/You-dont-need-analytics-on-your-blog):
  A good reminder for indie bloggers out there to remember *why* you're writing
  -- chasing higher audience numbers can be demotivating and futile if you're
  writing for your own enjoyment.
- [Emacs From Scratch, Part 1:
  Foundations](https://arne.me/articles/emacs-from-scratch-part-one-foundations):
  I really am loving how this series is introducing Emacs concepts in a slow
  drip. [I've used Doom Emacs](https://davi.sh/blog/2020/03/switching-to-emacs/)
  whenever I've dipped my toes in, but this series might give me the confidence
  to make a go of it on my own.
- [NixOS & Flakes Book](https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world/preface): One of
  the first things you'll learn about Nix is that the documentation is
  byzantine, to say the least. This book/website is refreshingly
  straightforward: explaining concepts like Flakes in-depth which the official
  docs don't even touch on. I run Nix on my macOS systems and haven't touched
  NixOS yet, but the book has still been full of great insights and tips.
- [Sam Altman's Knack for Dodging
  Bullets](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/sam-altman-openai-protected-by-silicon-valley-friends-f3efcf68):
  I was more than a little intrigued by the OpenAI drama a few weeks back, and
  I'm interested to see how those few days in November are unpacked and reported
  on more and more over the next few months.

## From the vault

Eventually the Weekly will just be links from the current week, but while I'm
getting started I'll also include some links "from the vault".

- [The Rust I Wanted Had No
  Future](https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/307291.html): Graydon Hoare describes
  the direction he would have taken Rust if he had truly been the BDFL for the
  language. In a lot of ways it is not what I would expect given where Rust has
  ended up. 
  
  What stuck with me the most was Graydon's objections to how library-defined
  iterators interact with the generics system and led in part to Rust's
  infamously slow compile times. It gave me more respect and understanding for
  Go's built-in container types and reluctance to release generics.
