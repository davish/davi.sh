It's once again been another month since my last update. I hope you find some interesting
reads in this issue, though!

I'm trying to read more this year, and I've been working on a new section of the website
for small book reviews inspired by [Tom MacWright's Reading
section](https://macwright.com/reading/) and [Arne Bahlo's
Library](https://arne.me/library). Building it has been my first real forray into "vibe
coding" with Cursor. The experience has been pretty great, and I was able to get a setup
I'm pretty happy with in about an hour.

Anyways, on to the links!

- [**The Best Programmers I Know**](https://endler.dev/2025/best-programmers/) (Matthias
  Endler): There's a lot of good advice in this post, but I think the over-arching
  takeaway among all the points is _Don't be afraid to get your hands dirty_. Taking
  existing abstractions for granted will force you to miss a lot of the details that could
  make the difference between building an acceptable system and an outstanding one.
  
- [**Why we ditched Next.js and never looked
  back**](https://northflank.com/blog/why-we-ditched-next-js-and-never-looked-back) (Will
  Stewart, Tom Snelling): "Build versus buy" is a big discussion at larger companies, but
  startups that supposedly shouldn't focus engineering effort outside of their core
  competency can also benefit from taking a deeper look at what benefits they're actually
  reaping from dependencies. 
  
  NextJS is an extremely powerful framework with a lot of features. This is great when
  prototyping a product that you don't yet know the final shape of, but can actually work
  against you if you don't actually *need* all those features. In line with the post
  above, _getting your hands dirty_ and just writing the 200 lines to implement React SSR
  can pay dividends in latency and engineering effort that would otherwise go towards
  fighting with the framework.
  
- [**JSX Over The Wire**](https://overreacted.io/jsx-over-the-wire/) (Dan Abramov): I'd
  say an appropriate subtitle for this post could be "React Server Components from First
  Principles". I first wrote about data fetching and full stack web frameworks [four and a
  half years ago](/blog/hotwiring%20the%20web/) and really enjoyed the in-depth look at
  how Facebook and the React team arrived at Server Components.
  
- [**The Post-Developer Era**](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/the-post-developer-era/)
  (Josh Comeau): An important gut-check that even as AI assistants are much more useful
  than they were two years ago, the must bullish predictions for where we'd be in 2025
  haven't proved themselves out. I appreciated the analogy to cruise control: while AI
  coding tools can take away a lot of the mental labor of writing code, you'll end up
  drifting out of the lane if you stop paying close attention. Josh didn't go this far,
  but I think the analogy can be extended all the way to self-driving cars: agentic,
  automated software engineers are probably in our future, but getting from 90%
  effectiveness to 99.9% effectiveness could take much longer than optimists expect.

- [**Making any integer with four
  2s**](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2025/making-any-integer-with-four-2s/) (Eli
  Bendersky): This post explained a real
  [ogre](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D-FtCTW2rVFM&ved=2ahUKEwjp_OC32eaMAxWem4kEHS1pOfAQtwJ6BAgNEAI&usg=AOvVaw2yja0RgdLnWrjPrZWeEqiJ)
  of a math problem. The progression of how you can "level up" your answer with
  more advanced and abstract math, all the way to a general answer, was fun to read.
