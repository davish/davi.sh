Happy new year! I just posted my [2024 year-in-review post](/blog/2024/12/2024-in-review/)
over on the other part of this site. It was fun to sum up the year, and I'm excited to see
where 2025 takes me! On to the links:

### From the webring

- [**Tips for New Open Source Maintainers**](https://lord.io/oss-tips/) (Robert Lord): A
  post written in 2014 by a former coworker that found its way to the [lobste.rs front
  page](https://lobste.rs/s/nuie8m) this past week. Like [Daniel Doubrovkine's
  post](https://code.dblock.org/2024/12/19/do-not-fix-bugs-reported-in-your-open-source-projects.html)
  I shared last week, I really wish I had read this a few years ago.

### Programming
- [**Collection of insane and fun facts about
  SQLite**](https://avi.im/blag/2024/sqlite-facts/) (v): I learned a lot of things about
  how SQLite is made -- it's definitely not the "standard" profitability path for tech.
- [**Django in 2024**](https://www.screamingatmyscreen.com/django-in-2024/) (Timo
  Zimmermann): I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for Django. I enjoyed reading
  about Timo's best practices, and will definitely take a deeper look at [Django
  Ninja](https://django-ninja.dev) sometime.
- [**Should Programming Languages be Safe or
  Powerful?**](https://lambdaland.org/posts/2024-11-21_powerful_or_safe_languages/)
  (Ashton Wiersdorf): The article is certainly Lisp-pilled, but had some interesting
  insight about how "power" in PL can be along different dimensions (manipulating memory,
  modeling state) and how expressiveness relates to power and safety. It would have been
  interesting to show an example of a language that the author didn't consider powerful as
  a counterexample.

### AI
- [**Things we learned about LLMs in
  2024**](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/31/llms-in-2024/) (Simon Willison): Simon's
  coverage of the development of LLMs over the past few years has struck the balance of
  optimisim and technical depth without ever diving into the hype/grifter industrial
  complex. This was a long but great summary of LLM developments over the past year.
