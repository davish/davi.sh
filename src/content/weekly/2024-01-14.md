- [**How to Discover Your Own
  Taste**](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/09/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-kyle-chayka.html): The Ezra
  Klein Show is a staple of my podcast rotation, and I thought this was a really thought-provoking
  episode that was a good one to listen to as the 2024 kicks into full gear. This newsletter is
  already part of my starting to cultivate my own taste more consciously -- independent curation is
  how we fight back against the algorithms!
- [**Redeployment Part One**](https://brr.fyi/posts/redeployment-part-one): brr.fyi has probably been my
  favorite blog of the past year. I love reading science fiction, and learning about what it's like
  living at South Pole Station in Antarctica scratches that same itch for me as some of my favorite
  book series.
- [**New in Fedora Asahi Remix**](https://asahilinux.org/2024/01/fedora-asahi-new/): I maintain that the
  Asahi Linux development blog produces one of the best techincal release notes on the
  internet. Lots of interesting tidbits about Mac hardware and the internals of MacOS.
- [**Is htmx Just Another JavaScript
  Framework?**](https://htmx.org/essays/is-htmx-another-javascript-framework/): A great article that
  also proves wrong [Betteridge's law of
  headlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines). It's great reading not
  just thoughts about the tools we make and use, but also thoughts about _how_ to think about them.
- [**What We Got Right, What We Got
  Wrong**](https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2024/01/what-we-got-right-what-we-got-wrong.html): Go is
  not my favorite programming language. Over time though, I've developed way more of an appreciation
  for _why_ they made some of the design choices that I've disagreed with. This talk was another
  interesting piece of the puzzle.

## From the Archives
- [**Dennis Ritchie on `& |` vs. `==`**](https://www.lysator.liu.se/c/dmr-on-or.html): Backwards
  compatibility is an issue that comes up all the time in database systems, and it was cool reading
  about how insurmountable it can feel, no matter the scale you're dealing with. "Success" is always
  relative.

Two well-written deep dives into indie game development on the web this week to round out the
Archives:

- [**Development notes from xkcd's "Gravity and "Escape
  Speed"**](https://chromakode.com/post/xkcd-gravity-escape-speed/)
