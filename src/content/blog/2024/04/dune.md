Dune Part Two hit theaters recently, which got me thinking about my own experience reading
Dune in the past, what I enjoyed about it, and my own personal headcannon that made this
novel more enjoyable for me. And hey, it's [April Cools](https://www.aprilcools.club), so
why not put pen to paper here?

I've read Dune a few times over the past ten years, and as immersive as the world and
politics are, a few discontinuities kept bothering me. 

- **Chicken-and-egg space travel**: How did humans get to Arrakis without spice when it
  seems to be discovered after the Butlerian Jihad?
- **The discovery of spice**: The Spice Melange is described as
essential to space travel, and yet the narrator and many characters talk about the time
of its discovery as if it was close to within living memory.
- **The universe's best-kept secret**: Throughout the beginning of Dune, spice is commonly
  referred to as a geriatric drug that slows down the effects of aging, and this is the
  explanation given to the reader and to Paul as to why it's so valuable a commodity. How,
  after 10,000 years, is it still not common knowledge among at least the Great Houses
  that spice induces hallucinations and prescience?

My own personal headcannon does in fact contradict the books as written, but makes Dune as
a standalone story more consistent to me. Rather than being an ancient part of the
traditions of the Fremen, the Spacing Guild, and the Bene Gesserit among others, **Spice is
a relatively recent discovery by the Empire**, probably in the last hundred years or
so. 

Arrakis itself was discovered at some point in the more distant past, but remained
mostly an ecological and scientific oddity rather than a center of commerce and resource
extraction. The Fremen's ancestors, The Zensunni Wanderers, were expelled from their
previous home at some point in the past, and discovered the Spice Melange soon after,
integrating it into their spiritual rituals and replacing _other_ awareness-spectrum
narcotics.

Spice is just **one** awareness-spectrum narcotic in Dune. What makes it special and
especially valuable is its potency, lack of side effects, and, especially, its addictive
properties. Once you use the spice, any other drug fail to have the same
awareness-expanding effect. Paul's lecture to Gaius Helen Mohaim and the Spacing Guild
representatives at the end of the book makes way more sense in this context.

Considering the life-extending properties of spice and large-scale extraction only
beginning 80 years before, it's likely that Mohaim and the Guild navigators or others in
their generation were likely the ones who made the decision to go all-in on Spice and
Arrakis, rather than Paul admonishing their predecessors thousands of years in the past.

While it's not really consistent with later books in the series, I feel like this
retcon/headcannon gives the characters of Dune a lot more agency in the history of their
world, and makes the Imperium feel a lot more dynamic rather than stuck in one place. It
also makes the Spice-as-oil analogy make a bit more sense as well.
