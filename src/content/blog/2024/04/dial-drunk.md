I like Noah Kahan's music. _Dial Drunk_ is probably my favorite one of his songs and every
time I hear the lyrics it's hard not to draw parallels between it and _Stick Season_,
Kahan's most popular song of the past few years. This isn't the deepest media analysis out
there on the internet, but I thought it would be cool to show some parallel lines between
the two songs.

I have no way of knowing if these are both actually written about the same relationship,
but the way they play against each other when they're interleaved is really interesting. I
like to think it captures two distinct stages of a person's process of moving on from a
relationship.

> I'm rememberin' I promised to forget you now

> But it's rainin', and I'm callin' drunk

**Stick Season**: It's not crazy to think that in the universe where he's singing the lyrics
of _Stick Season_ to this other person, she makes him promise to leave her alone.
