Last Wednesday, Penn [extended Spring Break by a week and moved classes
online for a semester][1] in response to the threat of COVID-19.
The same day, the WHO declared the virus's global spread officially a
pandemic. In the days since, I've packed up my dorm room and moved home.
I've tried
to see how I could use this time effectively -- tackling projects I wouldn't
necessarily have time for in a busy college schedule, and learning new
skills. Here's a good a place as any to jot down some of my ideas, and
hopefully it'll keep me somewhat accountable.

1. Re-make [When2Meet](https://when2meet.com). It's a super simple and well-liked
   tool on campus, and I think it would be a cool experience to see how I'd
   make it, and if I could find any ways to improve on it while keeping its
   simplicity. I've been interested in functional programming lately, so I
   think I'll try to tackle this using [ReasonML][2] and [Elixir][3].

2. Learn iOS development. Something I've been thinking about for a little
   bit. I've been enjoying frontend development more lately, and it might
   be cool to add another skill to my toolbox on this front, especially
   with how many product ideas are mobile-first.

3. Keep working on [Penn Labs](https://pennlabs.org) products. With students
   scattered around the globe, tools like [Penn Course
   Alert](https://penncoursealert.com) and [Penn Course Plan](https://penncourseplan.com) are
   going to be even more critical to students. We're hoping to release a new
   version of Penn Course Alert with some new and helpful features before
   Penn's course registration starts, and that deadline should help keep me
   motivated and moving.

4. Improving this site. This only just went up a week ago or so, and right
   now is still using a pretty vanilla theme. I'm planning on adding some
   features like a project showcase and spicing up the theme a bit, with some
   graphics and color.
