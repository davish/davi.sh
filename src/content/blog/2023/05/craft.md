Pablo Picasso is one of the most famous modern artists of the 20th century. While many of his paintings border on the abstract, his artistic skill didn't spontaneously emerge. When he was young, he sharpened his craft on more realistic and traditional paintings. Novelty and creativity are important parts of great art. Just as necessary to making anything great is the technical skill to take an thought and represent it precisely in the real world. Even abstract expressionists could paint unbelieveably realistic landscapes if they felt the need.

I'm certainly no great artist, but the lesson that practicing technical skill is an important part of creating worthwhile things doesn't just apply to art. I've got more than a few ideas for open-source projects and apps that I'd like to implement. I also have more than a few languages, frameworks and technologies that I'd like to dive deeper into. For a long time I've taken the advice that the best way to learn a new programming language or framework is to build a larger-scale project with it that you're excited about. What I'm realizing, though, is that [innovation tokens](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology) apply just as much to side projects where you're looking to grow and learn as they do for production applications. The more mental energy spent designing a UI and triaging issues the less energy there is for diving deep into a language, investigating performance bottlenecks and learning other tools.

I'll still push forward on my own side projects. But I'll also dedicate energy to honing technical skill on its own with some more well-defined projects that still require a lot of depth of implementation. I've started working my way through Crafting Interpreters, and plan on completing the tree-walking interpreter in Kotlin before moving on to the stack-based VM in Rust.
