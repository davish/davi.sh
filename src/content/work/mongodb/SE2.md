Software Engineer on Query Optimization.

- Worked on a team of four engineers to ship client and server-side query analysis for MongoDB's industry-first Queryable Encryption feature as reported in [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/mongodb-queryable-encryption-databases/), [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/07/mongodb-puts-a-focus-on-its-developer-data-platform/), and others.
- Led effort of 3 engineers to extend Queryable Encryption to support encrypted numeric ranges -- creating tickets, planning sprints and coordinating with stakeholders and other engineering teams.
- Spearheaded effort to standardize arithmetic evaluation in the MongoDB query language (MQL) to improve the consistency of MQL's semantics.
